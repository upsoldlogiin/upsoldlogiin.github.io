  <h1>Upùì∏ld Login</h1> 
  <p>If you are a current student, faculty, or staff member at a participating school, you can log in to Uphold using your school-issued email address and password. If you are not a current student, faculty, or staff member, you can still create an account and log in, but you will not have access to all of the features and benefits of Uphold.</p>

    <h2>Why is Uphold not working?</h2>
    <p>There are a few possible reasons why Uphold may not be working. First, check to make sure that you have entered your username and password correctly. If you have, and you're still having trouble, it's possible that Uphold is down for maintenance or experiencing technical difficulties. You can check the status of Uphold by visiting their website or contacting their customer support team. If neither of those options are available to you, it's possible that your account has been suspended or cancelled. In that case, you'll need to reach out to Uphold directly to find out what's going on.</p>
